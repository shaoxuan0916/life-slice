# Life Slice

Life Slice is a web application that helps you document and organize your life's meaningful moments. It allows you to:

- Record and preserve your life events
- Organize experiences into distinct journeys (like career, education, or personal growth)
- Break down each journey into smaller, memorable "slices" that tell your story
- Share your journeys with friends and family
- Favorite other users' journeys and react to their slices

Think of it as a digital life journal where each journey represents a different chapter of your life, and slices are the individual moments that make that chapter special.
